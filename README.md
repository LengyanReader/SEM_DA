 Practice of stuctural equation modeling 

**SEM** here is for the short of structural equation model, as the so-called second generation of classical multivariate statistics methods, it can be well-used for studying the the relationship of quantitative and qualitative methods using path-modeling-graph. It can become a powerful tool to conduct comprehensive analysis on problem defining, as the important fundation of other kinds of analytics.

Two popular methods dominate SEM in practice: covariance-based SEM (CBSEM) and partial least squares SEM (PLS-SEM, also called PLS path modeling). CB-SEM is primarily used to confirm (or reject) theories and their underlying hypotheses. This approach confirms/rejects hypotheses by determining how closely a proposed theoretical model can reproduce the covariance matrix for an observed sample dataset. In contrast, PLS has been introduced as a “causal–predictive” approach to SEM (Jöreskog & Wold, 1982, p. 270), which focuses on explaining the variance in the model’s dependent variables (Chin et al., 2020)
